# Reinforcement Learning with Decision Trees/Regression Trees

## Introduction
This Jupyter notebook explores the use of Decision Trees and Regression Trees in reinforcement learning. Decision Trees are simple models used for classification and regression tasks, while Regression Trees predict continuous values. In this notebook, we adapt these tree-based models for reinforcement learning scenarios.

## Algorithm
- **Decision Trees**:
  - Initialize with the entire dataset at the root node.
  - Select the best feature to split the data.
  - Recursively split data into subsets based on feature values.
  - Stop splitting based on criteria like depth or purity.
  - Assign class labels or values to leaf nodes.

- **Reinforcement Learning with Trees**:
  - Adapt trees for reinforcement learning by defining rules for actions.
  - Assign rewards to leaf nodes based on state-action pairs.
  - Update the tree using reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Advantages and Disadvantages
- **Advantages**:
  - Interpretability.
  - Handle mixed data.
  - No data normalization required.
  - Transparent decision-making process.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Prone to overfitting.
  - Sensitive to data variations.
  - Biased to dominant classes.
  - Limited expressiveness.

## Implementation
- **Decision Tree for Classification**:
  - Use the "Wine Quality Dataset" to classify wines into quality categories.

- **Regression Tree**:
  - Predict house prices using the "Housing Dataset."

## Conclusion
This notebook introduces the application of Decision Trees and Regression Trees in reinforcement learning. We demonstrate their adaptability and potential for making informed decisions in dynamic environments.
