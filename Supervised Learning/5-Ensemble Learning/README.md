# Ensemble Methods in Machine Learning

## Introduction
Ensemble methods are powerful techniques in machine learning that combine multiple models to improve predictive performance. This Jupyter notebook explores two common types of ensemble methods: Bagging and Random Forests.

## Bagging
Bagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, reduces variance by building multiple independent models and combining their predictions through averaging or voting. It enhances model stability and generalization.

### Advantages:
- Reduced Variance
- Improved Generalization
- Simple Implementation

### Disadvantages:
- Limited Bias Reduction
- Complexity
- Ensemble Size

## Random Forest
Random Forest is a popular ensemble method that enhances decision trees. It introduces randomness during data sampling and feature selection to improve predictive accuracy.

### Advantages:
- High Performance
- Reduced Overfitting
- Feature Importance
- Parallelization

### Disadvantages:
- Complexity
- Less Interpretability
- Slower Inference

## Implementation
We apply Bagging and Random Forest regressors to predict house prices using the "Housing Dataset." We preprocess the data and evaluate the models' performance in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) scores.

## Conclusion
Both Bagging and Random Forest regressors demonstrate moderate predictive performance on the dataset. While improvements are possible, these ensemble methods offer robust solutions for predicting house prices.
