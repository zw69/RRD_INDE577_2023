# Reinforcement Learning Jupyter Notebook

## Introduction

Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning Jupyter Notebook! This notebook focuses on implementing reinforcement learning algorithms, with a spotlight on the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm.

## k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Algorithm

**Overview:**
k-NN is a versatile machine learning method used for classification and regression tasks, relying on data similarity. It's simple, adaptable, but sensitive to the choice of 'k'.

**Implementation:**
- Initialization: Begin with labeled training data and an unlabeled data point.
- Distance Calculation: Compute distances between the new point and training data.
- k-Nearest Neighbors Selection: Identify the k closest data points based on distance.
- Prediction (Classification/Regression): Use majority voting for classification and mean value for regression.

**Dataset:**
We use the Swiss Roll dataset, a 3D dataset illustrating non-linear structures and continuous features.

**Usage:**
- For classification, categorize continuous targets.
- For manifold learning, demonstrate dimensionality reduction.
- Analyze continuous feature interactions and non-linear structures.

## Choosing the Right 'k'

Consider data characteristics and use methods like cross-validation and error rate vs. 'k' plots to find the optimal 'k' value.
