# Gradient Descent - Regression

## Introduction

Welcome to the Gradient Descent - Regression project! In this Jupyter notebook, we explore the Gradient Descent optimization algorithm and its application in regression tasks. Gradient Descent is a powerful iterative optimization method used to find parameter values that minimize a cost function, making it crucial in various machine learning models.

## Algorithm Overview

Gradient Descent Regression is particularly useful for minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) cost function in regression models. Here's a brief overview of the algorithm:

1. **Initialization:** Start by initializing the regression coefficients (weights).
2. **Cost Function:** Define the cost function, which quantifies the error between predicted and actual values (typically MSE for regression).
3. **Gradient Calculation:** Calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to each coefficient.
4. **Updating Coefficients:** Update the weights by moving them in the direction opposite to the gradient, scaled by a learning rate.
5. **Iteration:** Repeatedly perform steps 3 and 4 until convergence (the cost function stops decreasing significantly) or after a set number of iterations.
6. **Stochastic and Mini-batch Variants:** For efficiency, consider Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Mini-batch Gradient Descent, which use subsets of data for updates.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**

- Scalability and Efficiency: Suitable for large datasets and computationally efficient.
- Flexibility: Applicable to a wide range of optimization problems in machine learning.
- Simplicity: Conceptually straightforward to understand and implement.
- Applicability to Non-linear Problems: Can optimize non-linear models, offering versatility.

**Disadvantages:**

- Sensitivity to Learning Rate: The choice of the learning rate can significantly affect performance.
- Risk of Converging to Local Minima: In non-convex functions, it can get stuck in local minima.
- Feature Scaling Requirement: Requires careful feature scaling for efficient convergence.
- Sensitivity to Initial Conditions: Starting point can affect convergence, especially in complex spaces.
- Plateau Problems: May slow down near plateaus or saddle points, extending convergence time.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Requires tuning of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, momentum).

## Implementation

In this project, we'll work with the "housing price dataset," focusing on factors such as house area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and parking. We'll perform the following steps:

1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Implement the Gradient Descent Regression algorithm.
3. Train the regression model.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
5. Visualize the MSE over iterations to understand convergence.

## Conclusion

Gradient Descent is a fundamental optimization technique that underpins many machine learning algorithms. By exploring its application in regression, we gain insights into how it can be used to minimize cost functions and make accurate predictions.

Feel free to dive into the notebook, experiment with hyperparameters, and explore the algorithm's behavior in the context of regression.

Happy learning and optimizing!
