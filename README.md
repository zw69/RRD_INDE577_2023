# INDE 577 Final Project - Data Science and Machine Learning

**Instructor**: Randy R. Davila

## Course Description

Welcome to the final project repository for INDE 577 - Data Science and Machine Learning. This course, instructed by Randy R. Davila, has covered a wide range of topics in data science and machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Throughout the semester, we have delved into practical implementations, programming using Python, and various data science practices.

## Project Structure

This repository is organized into four main sections, each containing detailed implementations and analyses:

### Supervised Learning

In this section, we have implemented various supervised learning algorithms:

- **Perceptron**: A simple linear classifier.
- **Logistic Regression**: A binary and multiclass classification algorithm.
- **Neural Network (MLP)**: Multi-layer perceptron for deep learning.
- **Decision/Regression Trees**: Tree-based models for classification and regression.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Ensemble methods like Random Forest.
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric classification algorithm.

### Unsupervised Learning

This section focuses on unsupervised learning techniques:

- **k-Means Clustering**: A clustering algorithm for grouping data points.
- **DBSCAN**: Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction for feature extraction.

### Reinforcement Learning

In the reinforcement learning section, we explore:

- **Tabular Reinforcement Learning**: An introduction to reinforcement learning concepts.

### Datasets

The datasets folder contains various datasets used in our implementations:

- **Albumlist**: Top 500 albums of all time.
- **Housing**: The dataset contains housing price and related attributes.
- **MNIST Train**: The training set of the MNIST handwritten digit dataset.
- **MNIST Test**: The testing set of the MNIST handwritten digit dataset.
- **Spotify 2023**: Most streamed tracks of 2023 on Spotify.

## Repository Navigation

To explore our work, navigate to the respective folders for supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and datasets. Each folder contains detailed README.md files and Jupyter notebooks showcasing the implementations.

Thank you for reviewing our final project repository. We hope you find our implementations and analyses insightful and well-organized.
