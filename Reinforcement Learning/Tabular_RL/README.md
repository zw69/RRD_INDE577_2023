# Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction

Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning project! This Jupyter notebook focuses on applying reinforcement learning techniques to the game of Connect Four. In this project, you'll find an agent that learns to make strategic moves in the Connect Four game.

## How to Use

To interact with the Reinforcement Learning Connect Four game:

1. Open the Jupyter notebook file.

2. Follow the provided code and instructions to execute the reinforcement learning implementation.

3. Experience the Connect Four game with the trained RL agent.

4. Observe how the agent learns to make optimal moves to win or draw in Connect Four.

## About Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning subfield that teaches agents to make decisions by trial and error. In this project, you'll see RL in action as it learns from interactions with the game environment.

Enjoy playing Connect Four with our RL agent!
