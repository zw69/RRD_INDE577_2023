Below, we introduce the five datasets used in our project.

### Albumlist Dataset

The **Albumlist** dataset comprises a collection of iconic albums featured in Rolling Stone's top 500 albums of all time. It includes essential information such as the album's release year, title, artist, genre, and subgenre. This dataset serves as the foundation for exploring music-related analyses and predictions.

### Housing Dataset

The **Housing** dataset is a valuable resource for examining real estate trends and property characteristics. With 13 features and 545 samples, it provides insights into house prices, areas, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and various attributes. Explorations using this dataset offer valuable real estate market insights.

### MNIST Datasets

We utilize two essential datasets for image classification tasks:

1. **MNIST Train**: This dataset contains 60,000 training examples and labels. It serves as the primary training data for our image classification models.
2. **MNIST Test**: Comprising 10,000 test examples and labels, this dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of our image classification models. Each example consists of 785 values, with the first value representing the label (0 to 9) and the remaining 784 values representing pixel intensities.

### Spotify 2023 Dataset

The **Spotify 2023** dataset offers a comprehensive view of the most streamed songs in 2023 on Spotify. With detailed information about each song's attributes, popularity, and presence on various music platforms, it presents exciting opportunities for music analysis. Key features include track names, artist names, release dates, streaming statistics, and audio features.
