# DBSCAN Clustering

## Introduction

Welcome to the DBSCAN Clustering project! This Jupyter notebook explores the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm, a powerful unsupervised clustering technique known for its ability to identify clusters of arbitrary shapes within datasets. Unlike traditional clustering algorithms, DBSCAN defines clusters based on the density of data points in feature space, making it particularly effective in handling datasets with irregularly shaped clusters and identifying outliers or noise points.

## About DBSCAN Algorithm

DBSCAN operates by estimating local density around each data point, identifying core points, forming clusters by connecting densely connected core points, and expanding clusters by assigning border points. The algorithm also handles noise points, which do not belong to any cluster. DBSCAN's ability to create clusters based on data density, without the need to specify the number of clusters in advance, makes it a robust and flexible clustering technique.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:
- Robust to varying shapes, sizes, and densities of clusters.
- Effective noise detection and labeling.
- Automatic determination of the number of clusters.
- Suitable for datasets with non-uniform cluster densities.

Disadvantages:
- Sensitivity to parameters (epsilon and minPts) requiring careful tuning.
- Performance deterioration in high-dimensional spaces.
- Higher memory and time requirements for large datasets.

## Illustration

- The data points are grouped into clusters based on their density, with red and blue clusters representing the main clusters.
- Green points represent noise or outliers, which do not belong to any cluster due to their low density.
- DBSCAN effectively identifies clusters based on data density, including non-linear clusters like the moon-shaped clusters in the visualization.
- The algorithm adapts to the dataset's structure without the need for specifying the number of clusters in advance.
