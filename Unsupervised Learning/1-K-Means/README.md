# k-Means Clustering

## Introduction

Welcome to the k-Means Clustering project! This Jupyter notebook explores the k-Means clustering algorithm, a widely-used unsupervised machine learning technique for partitioning data into clusters based on similarity patterns. In this project, we'll delve into the workings of k-Means, its applications, and its advantages and disadvantages.

## About k-Means Clustering

k-Means Clustering is a versatile algorithm used for various tasks such as customer segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection. It aims to group data points into clusters so that points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. The algorithm involves initializing cluster centroids, assigning data points to the nearest centroids, and iteratively updating centroids to optimize clustering.

## k-Means Algorithm

The k-Means algorithm comprises several key steps:
1. Initialization: Randomly select k initial cluster centroids.
2. Assignment: Assign each data point to the cluster with the nearest centroid.
3. Update Centroids: Recalculate cluster centroids based on the mean of data points in each cluster.
4. Iteration: Repeat the assignment and centroid update steps until convergence or a specified number of iterations.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:
- Simplicity and ease of implementation.
- Computational efficiency, suitable for large datasets.
- Scalability for datasets with varying dimensions.
- Results are interpretable, as clusters are defined by centroids.

Disadvantages:
- Sensitivity to initialization, impacting clustering results.
- Assumes clusters have equal variance and are spherical.
- Requires specifying the number of clusters (k) in advance.

## Illustration

To illustrate k-Means clustering, we use a synthetic dataset in the shape of a rolled Swiss cake. The algorithm's application to this dataset demonstrates its capability to capture complex patterns and group data effectively.
